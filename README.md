Below is a polished, professional, and more complete version of your README. I have updated the structure, improved clarity, corrected typos (e.g., *passport.js*), and added a dedicated section about your work as a **Data Scientist** while keeping your original tone.

You can copy–paste this directly into your GitHub README.

# Hi there, I'm Rohit Gupta!

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** specializing in the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)** and a **Data Scientist** with hands-on experience in building predictive models and solving real-world analytical problems. I enjoy designing scalable applications, exploring new technologies, and turning data into actionable insights.

## 🧠 What I Do

I work at the intersection of **software engineering and data science**, building end-to-end solutions—from intuitive frontends and powerful backends to data-driven models that enhance decision-making and product functionality.

## 💼 Technical Skills

### **Frontend**

* React, Redux
* HTML5, CSS3
* Bootstrap, Material UI, Ant Design

### **Backend**

* Node.js, Express.js
* MongoDB, Mongoose
* Firebase
* REST APIs, Authentication (Passport.js, JWT)

### **Data Science & Machine Learning**

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
* Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
* Classification, Regression, Clustering models
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Model Deployment & Integration

### **Other Technologies**

* Docker
* PostgreSQL, MySQL
* Java, C
* CI/CD basics
* Cloud Deployment (Vercel, Firebase Hosting)

### **Tools**

* Git & GitHub
* Figma
* VS Code
* Postman

## 🌟 Featured Projects

* **[Personal Finance Tracker](https://github.com/rgrohitgupta938/finance-tracker)**
  A React-based application for tracking expenses and income, integrated with Firebase authentication and real-time database.

* **[Travel Enthusiasts Social Media Platform](https://socialprj.web.app/)**
  A social platform for sharing travel stories, photos, and experiences—built with scalable backend APIs and Firebase services.

* **[Job Portal Web App](https://github.com/rgrohitgupta938/job-portal)**
  A complete job portal with separate roles for job seekers, employers, and admins, featuring advanced search and secure authentication.

## 🧑‍💼 Professional Snapshot as a Data Scientist

Alongside full-stack development, I apply data science techniques to build intelligent systems. My recent work includes:

* Developing ML models for **fraud detection**, **recommendation engines**, and **classification tasks**.
* Conducting **end-to-end data workflows**: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
* Integrating predictive insights into web applications for enhanced user experience.
* Working with real-world datasets using Python, Scikit-learn, and visualization tools.

This hybrid skill set enables me to design applications that are not only functional and visually appealing but also smart and data-driven.
